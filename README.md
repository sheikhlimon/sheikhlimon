[Engineering Logs](https://sheikhlimon.vercel.app/logs) • [Project Portfolio](https://sheikhlimon.vercel.app/projects)

> I build the system infrastructure that allows AI agents to interact safely with the Unix process model. I focus on environment stability, CLI resilience, and open-source distribution.

### 🛠 Open Source & Systems Impact

My work focuses on the **operational reliability** of the [goose ecosystem](https://github.com/block/goose), ensuring that agentic tools integrate seamlessly with Linux and Unix-like environments.

- **Systems Engineering:** I contribute to core CLI resilience, focusing on environment variable management, cross-platform auth stability (WSL/Linux/Mac), and process isolation.
- **Ecosystem Maintenance:** Maintainer of official-community Arch Linux (AUR) builds: [`goose-desktop`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/goose-desktop) | [`goose-desktop-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/goose-desktop-bin)
- **Problem Solver:** Recognized for proactive debugging in security and configuration layers (Keyring/Secret management).
