# Hi 👋, I'm Limon

**Full Stack Engineer · [Goose Community All-Star](https://github.com/block/goose/discussions/6852) (Jan 2026)**

> I build the system infrastructure that allows AI agents to interact safely with the Unix process model. I focus on environment stability, CLI resilience, and open-source distribution.

### 🛠 Open Source & Systems Impact

My work focuses on the **operational reliability** of the [goose ecosystem](https://github.com/block/goose), ensuring that agentic tools integrate seamlessly with Linux and Unix-like environments.

- **Systems Engineering:** I contribute to core CLI resilience, focusing on environment variable management, cross-platform auth stability (WSL/Linux/Mac), and process isolation.
- **Ecosystem Maintenance:** I maintain the official-community Arch Linux (AUR) builds, ensuring stable and reproducible distribution:
  - [`goose-desktop`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/goose-desktop) | [`goose-desktop-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/goose-desktop-bin)
- **Problem Solver:** Recognized for proactive debugging in security and configuration layers (Keyring/Secret management).

### 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

- **Upstream First:** Solving problems at the source to benefit the entire community.
- **Boring Systems Win:** Reliability isn't an accident; it's the result of choosing simple, robust architectures.
- **Code over Credentials:** I lead with PRs. Technical merit is the primary currency of OSS.

### 📓 Technical Documentation

I document my architectural decisions and engineering hurdles to help others learn from my process.
