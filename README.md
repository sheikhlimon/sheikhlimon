# Hi 👋, I'm Limon

**OSS Contributor @ Goose (Linux Foundation/AAIF) | Maintaining the Goose AUR Packages**

I ship and maintain production-grade features through open-source software. I believe in **code over credentials** and building systems that are "boring" because they actually work.

### 🛠 What I Do

- **Open Source:** Actively contributing to the **Goose** ecosystem under the **Linux Foundation/AAIF**.
- **Systems Engineering:** Backend-focused engineer dogfooding agentic AI workflows. I focus on tool-use, context-shaping, and reliable developer tooling.
- **Packages:** Maintainer of **[goose-desktop](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/goose-desktop)** and **[goose-desktop-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/goose-desktop-bin)** on the Arch User Repository (AUR).
- **Philosophy:** Building reliable, high-uptime systems that solve real developer pain points.

### 📓 Engineering Logs & Projects

I document my work and thinking through **[engineering logs](https://sheikhlimon.vercel.app/logs)** and a curated set of **[projects](https://sheikhlimon.vercel.app/projects)**. I’m a firm believer that the best way to learn is to break things in production—then build a script to make sure they never break again.

### 💻 Stack

- **OS:** Arch Linux (btw)
- **Editor:** Neovim
- **Core:** TypeScript, Node.js, Shell Scripting, AI SDKs (MCP)
