# Hi 👋, I'm Limon

**Full Stack Engineer & OSS Contributor @ goose (Linux Foundation/AAIF)**

### 🛠 What I Do

- **Systems Engineering:** Contributing to the goose ecosystem. I focus on tool-use reliability and environment stability, using AI to automate the "boring" parts of engineering
- **Dogfooding:** I use Goose to build Goose. I focus on context-shaping to ensure AI agents operate predictably within the Linux process model
- **Ecosystem Maintenance:** Bridging the gap between upstream development and downstream distribution. I maintain **[goose-desktop](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/goose-desktop)** and **[goose-desktop-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/goose-desktop-bin)** AUR packages
- **Philosophy:** I believe in **code over credentials** and building systems that are "boring" because they actually work

### 📓 Engineering Logs & Projects
